note to self- learning to use github correcly:
I am working i parallel both weatherapp plus exercises of prep bootcamp lighhouse Labs
I am testing this change to see if the time stamp of git commit will update correctly:
yes it did work. apparently when doing git add git push git origin master from the terminal runing on a virtual machine the time stamp is of the virtual machine? seems to be in another date.

When I tried to google the solution found this in stackoverflow and actually used it in repo lighhouse
```git commit --amend --date="Sun Sep 26 14:00 2011 +0100" --no-edit```
It effectivelly created the coomit but made it another branch to avoid doble files...
